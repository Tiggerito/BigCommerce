    Image classes
    All images generated here will have the "responsive-img" class. Use this class to control how the background looks before any image is shown.
    If lazy-loading is enabled, images will have the "lazyload" class so that Lazysizes will target them automatically.
    If lazy-loading is enabled, images will have the "loading-lazy" class, otherwise the "loading-auto" class.
    If lqip is enabled, images will have the "loading-lqip" class, otherwise the "loading-blank" class.
    Use the "loading-lqip" class to make sure LQIP background images are aligned correctly.

    Lazysizes fallback
    By default the browsers native lazy-loading mechanism is used. If this is not available (Safari) there is an option to fall back to using the Lazysizes library.
    To do this you need to add a script to the head of the base.html and switch a boolean in this code.
    The script detects if lazy-loading is supported and either updates all images to use it, or loads Lazysizes as the fallback.
    This also means independent use of the Lazysizes pattern is possible https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes#modern-transparent-srcset-pattern
 
    There are a few important arguments to know about when using this component:
    `lazyload`: 'lazyload', 'disabled', 'lazyload+lqip', 'disabled+lqip'

        - 'lazyload': This means the image will use the browsers built in lazy-load mechanism to delay the loading of images
             that are not initially visible (or close to visible) on the page.
             This speeds up the loading of the page, especially when it is long and with lots of images.
             If the browser does not support lazy-loading (like Safari) there is an optional fallback to using the Lazysize library.
        - 'disabled': This means it will not attempt to lazy-load the image and instead tell the browser to load it in the normal way (auto).
             Use this for high-priority images that are typically visible on initial page load.
        - '+lqip': This will load a low-res image in the background (CSS background-image) of where the full size image will be loaded.
            On slower connections the user will initially see a blurry version of the image as a placeholder while the main image loads.
            This can provide a better user experience but does add the loading of an extra small image.
            If not specified, the user will see a blank space until the image appears. You could use CSS (.responsive-img or .loading-lqip) to alter the appearance.
            This is of most value for larger images.
 
    `fallback_size`:
        This is the size to use for this image in legacy browsers that do not support srcset.
        Can be defined as a pixel bounding-box size (e.g. "123x123) or inherent width (e.g. "123w").
        Not required if 1x is specified
    
    `class`:
        Extra CSS classes to add to the image, e.g. "card-image".    
    
    `otherAttributes`:
        Any other HTML attributes you want on the img tag, for example "height='100' width='100'"
        Specifying height and width can reduce Layout Shifts. They can also be specified in CSS
    
    `default_image`:
        The default image to use if `image` is undefined or falsy. Should be a theme asset, usually defined as a relative
        path in the theme config. If a default image is not provided, you'll get an image tag with no image if the primary
        image is undefined.
    
    `lqip_size`:
        If you want to specify a particular size for the LQIP image, you can do so with this argument. 
        A default of 80 pixels wide will be used otherwise. This argument has no effect if the lazyload mode does not end in "+lqip".
        
     `sizes`:
        The sizes attribute value. Required if there are multiple width based entries in the srcset and the image is not going to be 100% width of the viewport. 
        It is used to determine which of the images in srcset to use.
        Not required if x1 is supplied as it enforces a single image size
        
      `1x`, `2x`:
        Can be defined as a pixel bounding-box size (e.g. "123x123) or inherent width (e.g. "123w").
        Lets you specify that only a single 1x (and optional 2x) image should be included in the srcset. 
        Useful if the images placeholder is a fixed width or does not vary much, then we only need the one image.
        It will reduce code bloat and complexity   
        If used, fallback size is not required.
        2x will only work if 1x is also provided. I could not get 1.5x to work.
        I've not added this to all the possible places yet.
    
      Ideas
      Ability to use browser setting for Save-Data or network speed to disable LQIP and maybe even reduce image sizes.

            If enabled, use lazysizes to support lazy-loading on Safari. 
            Lazysizes generates the 'sizes' attribute automatically which would sometimes be more accurate than when we manually set sizes
            However lazysizes needs to wait for rendering to do this, meaning image loading is delayed and can't be reliably preloaded.
